    | I'm Mike, a UI/UX designer from Ireland. I studied Digital Media at Edinburgh Napier University and gratuated in 2010. I have lived in London, Edinburgh, Australia and I'm currently back at home in Dublin. I have been self employed for a number of years and during that time I provided small to medium businesses with print and web solutions. In 2015 I started working at Nettl as a Brand Stylist.
